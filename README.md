##Objective of project

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the film industry. By analyzing data related to movie genres, release years, popularity scores, and average viewer ratings, the project aims to identify patterns and trends that influence a movie's success and audience reception.

The project focuses on cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting date formats, splitting genre information, and categorizing vote averages into meaningful groups. After preprocessing, the dataset is explored using descriptive statistics and visual tools to reveal relationships between variables.

Another key objective is to understand how movie popularity and ratings have evolved over time, which genres are most frequently produced or most preferred, and how audience preferences shift across different years. This analysis can help stakeholders—such as producers, directors, marketers, and data scientists—make informed decisions based on historical data and trends.

Furthermore, through the use of data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, the project aims to present findings in a clear, engaging, and interpretable manner. Line plots, bar charts, box plots, and donut charts are used to effectively communicate results and highlight key observations.

In summary, the goal is to transform a raw movie dataset into actionable insights through data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization, ultimately supporting better content planning, marketing strategies, and user recommendation systems within the entertainment industry.
